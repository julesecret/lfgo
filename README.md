For you and me. Let's go
***What we need => make offers on nft with code***

infura, alternative to metamask to use a crypto wallet: https://docs.infura.io/infura
good article: https://coderrocketfuel.com/article/configure-infura-with-web3-js-and-node-js
opensea sdk I was not able to use: https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/opensea-js

***SPECS:***
(1) Use infura to connect to the blockchain and make actions with a wallet
(2) use this wallet to make offers on opensea with the opensea sdk. Or maybe we can interact with the blockchain without opensea?
